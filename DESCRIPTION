Description: (a) Estimates latent correlation for multivariate mixed data types; continuous, truncated, ordinal (any number of categories), and binary, (b) Covariance estimation and functional principal components 
    analysis for continous, truncated, discrete (ordinal/binary) functional data. The methods are described in
